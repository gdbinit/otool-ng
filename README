This is a fork from Apple's otool with my personal modifications to otool.

Otool is one of my favourite reversing tools since I work a lot from Terminal.app.
The introduction of LC_MAIN as replacement for LC_UNIXTHREAD lost the entrypoint address information.
Now you need to calculate the address, which is a another step and I'm too lazy for that!

I also modified the output of some fields to hexadecimal values because I also hate to convert
those values all the time.

The -z option was added. It will invert the current PIE flag, remove if set, set if removed.
It's something I use from time to time and it's faster than loading into MachOView and changing there.

If you have any suggestions or improvements feel free to contact me, send patches, etc.

Enjoy,
fG!
